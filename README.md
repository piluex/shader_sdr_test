# SDR & OpenGL
I was going to learn shaders and play with the RTL-SDR...

Then my videocard sucked at shaders for this application (no buffers, shitty uniforms). I ended up learning something about shaders, using the SDR quite well and playing with openGL.

Made to run in linux with SDL2 OpenGL and GLEW.
